## Amazon Elastic Compute Cloud (Amazon EC2) 
is a web service that provides secure, resizable compute capacity in the cloud.
It is designed to make web-scale cloud computing easier for developers.
Amazon EC2’s simple web service interface allows you to obtain and configure capacity with minimal friction.
It provides you with complete control of your computing resources and lets you run on Amazon’s proven computing environment.

## Reliable, Scalable, Infrastructure On Demand

* Increase or decrease capacity within minutes, not hours or days
* SLA commitment of 99.99% availability for each Amazon EC2 region.
  Each region consists of at least 3 availability zones
* The AWS Region/AZ model has been recognized by Gartner as the recommended 
  approach for running enterprise applications that require high availability
  
 # How to Create an EC2 Instance for AWS.
 The process for creating an EC2 instance when using AWS can become quite complex. 
 You can manually create key pairs used to log in to the instance, 
 for example, or create a special security group to help maintain EC2 security.
 In addition, you can use a custom AMI to configure your instance. 
 The problem is that all these extra steps make what should be a relatively 
 simple process for experimentation purposes quite difficult.

 ## 7. Step 1: Choose an Amazon Machine Image (AMI)
 The Choose an Amazon Machine Image (AMI) page displays a list of basic configurations called Amazon Machine Images (AMIs) that serve as templates for your instance. Select the HVM edition of the Amazon Linux AMI. Notice that this configuration is marked Free tier eligible. 
 
 You can search for required **Operating System**, In This Demo we will create instance of Linux
 select the first option **Amazon Linux 2 AMI (HVM), SSD Volume Type**
 If You are creating windows Instance ,**Volume Should be >= 50 GB**
 you will be charged per hour for windows you also have to pay for licence(**per hr**)(**pay as you use**)

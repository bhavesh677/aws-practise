is a web service that provides secure, resizable compute capacity in the cloud.
It is designed to make web-scale cloud computing easier for developers.
Amazon EC2’s simple web service interface allows you to obtain and configure capacity with minimal friction.
It provides you with complete control of your computing resources and lets you run on Amazon’s proven computing environment.

## Reliable, Scalable, Infrastructure On Demand

* Increase or decrease capacity within minutes, not hours or days

 # How to Create an EC2 Instance for AWS.
 The process for creating an EC2 instance when using AWS can become quite complex. 
 You can manually create key pairs used to log in to the instance,

 In addition, you can use a custom AMI to configure your instance. 
 The problem is that all these extra steps make what should be a relatively 
 simple process for experimentation purposes quite difficult.
